    "# Gradient Boosting Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique used for both regression and classification tasks. It builds a strong predictive model by combining the outputs of several weak learners, typically decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind gradient boosting is to sequentially correct the errors of previous models. Each new model minimizes the loss function by focusing on the residual errors made by the previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Gradient Boosting Works\n",
    "1. **Initial Prediction:**\n",
    "   - The process begins by making an initial prediction, often the mean of the target values for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Residuals:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the residuals (errors) between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train a Weak Learner:**\n",
    "   - Fit a simple decision tree (a weak learner) to predict the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the Prediction:**\n",
    "   - Add the predictions of the weak learner to the previous predictions to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat:**\n",
    "   - Continue adding weak learners, each correcting the mistakes of the previous ensemble until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently low error).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let's consider a regression problem where we want to predict house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n",
    "Suppose the initial prediction for the house prices is the average price: $200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first weak learner sees that some houses are underpriced by $50,000 while others are overpriced by $30,000.\n",
    "2. This decision tree attempts to predict these residuals.\n",
    "3. The model updates the prediction, so now the prediction might be $200,000 + adjustments from the first tree.\n",
    "4. Subsequent trees focus on the remaining errors until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Gradient Boosting\n",
    "- Handles both regression and classification problems.\n",
    "- Can capture complex patterns in data.\n",
    "- High predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Considerations\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.\n",
    "- Training can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of trees, learning rate, and tree depth.\n"
